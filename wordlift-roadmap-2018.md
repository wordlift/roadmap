# Product Challenges ==1==/3
### what we ==learned== from ==our users== :

1. Building the **==vocabulary==** is *painful* 
2. The initial **==learning curve==** is *steep*
3. The **==analysis==** *not always works* as it should
4. Automatically publishing *all* **==entity pages==** is *scary* 
5. **==Images==** from the Commons are *crap*

# Product Challenges ==2==/3
### how ==the world== around us ==is changing==:

6. **==Gutenberg==** will fundamentally transform *WordPress* 
7. **==Voice Search==** will get *bigger* and **==PASO==** will become *key* for brands (small and large)
8. Google **==Knowledge Graph==** will get *more important* than **featured snippets**
9. **==Chatbots==** and **==Instant Messaging==** will *drive traffic*
10. **==Graph==** is the **enterprise** *data model* for the next 20+ yrs

# Product Challenges ==3==/3
#### ==Too Much== - ==Too Early==


> we have a tendency to ==**over-strech project goals**== and **==keep features as open as  possible==**.

# In a nutshell :chestnut: here is what we can  do 

1. **Make WordLift** ==**easy to use**== and ==**agentive**== (*weekly digests*, *dashboard*, ...) :point_right: we need to *create* and *nurture* an **==open channel==** with our clients
2. Focus on `VIP Clients` and **end-to-end services** on top of ==**WordLift**== and ==**WooRank**==
3. **Train clients on the technology** and always be `innovative`
4. Bring ==**WordLift Cloud**== to ==**WooRank**==  
5. **Make ==websites talk==**
6. Build the **==Italian market==**

# Research and Development Work :gem:
#### what are we experimenting with?

- ==**Content summarization**== this is **crucial** for chatbot and could be also a solution to `missing meta descriptions`
- ==**Conversational UIs**== and ==**Voice Search**==  to improve the engagement on content or to help users find it 
- **Automatic ==Image captioning==** for `missing alt tags`
- **==Content crawling==** for `vocabulary seeding` (feeding the graph with content crawled from the web)
- ==**Q&A**== content extraction and ==**ChatPal**== by Redlink
